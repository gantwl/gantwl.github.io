---

My name is Luke Gant. I am a senior international and comparative politics major at Appalachian States University. I have interests in International Relief and International Non-profit's. I am also Microsoft Excel and Access certified and familiar with analysis programs such as R and R studio. Living in the high country for the past 4 years has made me appreciate the outdoors and enjoy activities such as hiking, fishing, and camping.
